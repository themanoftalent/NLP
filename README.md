# Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python

## Overview
This repository provides a collection of Python scripts and resources for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. This repository is intended to help you get started with NLP using Python and popular libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.

## Installation
To use the scripts and resources in this repository, you'll need to set up a Python environment and install the necessary libraries. You can create a virtual environment for your project using `virtualenv` or `conda` to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
virtualenv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started
Before diving into NLP tasks, it's essential to understand the basics of Python and the libraries we'll be using. Make sure you're familiar with Python syntax, data structures, and how to work with external libraries.

## NLP Libraries
In this repository, we use the following popular NLP libraries:
- [NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/): A comprehensive library for NLP tasks.
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/): A fast and efficient library for NLP with pre-trained models.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A machine learning library that is often used in NLP for text classification and clustering.

You should install these libraries before using the provided scripts.

## Basic NLP Tasks
Explore the basics of NLP by working through the provided scripts for common tasks, such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. These tasks lay the foundation for more complex NLP applications.

## Text Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial in NLP. Learn how to clean and preprocess text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing other operations. This is essential for making your text data ready for modeling.

## Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is a key step in NLP. This section covers techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF for converting text data into numerical features that can be used in machine learning models.

## NLP Models
Explore different NLP models such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER). Learn how to build, train, and evaluate NLP models using popular libraries.

## Advanced NLP Topics
For those looking to delve deeper into NLP, we have resources on advanced topics such as word embeddings, sequence-to-sequence models, and deep learning for NLP tasks.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository. If you have additional scripts, examples, or improvements to share, please open a pull request. You can also report issues or suggest new features.

Happy NLP coding!
